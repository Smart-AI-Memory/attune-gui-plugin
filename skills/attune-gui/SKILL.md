# Launch attune-gui Dashboard

The user wants the dashboard open. Run the /attune-gui command steps:

1. Determine the attune-gui project path:
   - Run: `grep -s 'name = "attune-gui"' pyproject.toml`
   - Match → resolved path is `.`
   - No match but `./attune-gui/` exists → resolved path is `./attune-gui`
   - Neither → tell the user: "attune-gui not found. Install with: `pip install attune-gui` then open Claude Code from the attune-gui project directory." and stop.

2. Check `.claude/launch.json` — if it does not exist or has no `"attune-gui"` entry, write it:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.0.1",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "name": "attune-gui",
         "runtimeExecutable": "uv",
         "runtimeArgs": ["run", "--directory", "<resolved-path>", "attune-gui"],
         "port": 8000
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Replace `<resolved-path>` with the path from step 1. If the entry already exists, skip.

3. Call `mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_start` with `name: "attune-gui"`.

4. Tell the user: "attune-gui is running at http://localhost:8000 — dashboard is open in the preview pane."
